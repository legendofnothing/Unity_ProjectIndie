  - name: 'TRL-02: ABANDONED VALLEY'
    description: Outside of this city lies a radio station. If we manage to have
      a hold of it, we will be able to communicate with the central government and
      ask for help. The enemy knows how important this place is so expect them to

    description: Turns out, this sisutation is more complicated than we thought.
      No one know what lies here, and you will have to conduct recon mission here,
